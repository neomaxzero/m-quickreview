# Observe-rect

> Watch for resize on DOM nodes

## Good
- Well optimized.

## Bad
- Poor documentation.

## Doubts
- Should I add tests to this?

## Learnt
- Key/Value in a Map structure can be whatever you want!!! - Damn that to much power for us. Simple Humans.
- RequestAnimationFrame was recursive. Was hell of hard to understand a few lines of code. Worth it.
- Was a great source of knowledge.

## Overall

- Idk if is the first that exists that does that but next step is to check it out if there are other libraries around.

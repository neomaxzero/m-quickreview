# Image Compressor
> https://github.com/xkeshi/image-compressor

My usecase: I needed to upload compressed images to a server with height and width limits.

## Good
- Works out of the box.
- Straightforward API.
- Example convince me.
- Support from IE10.
- Small lib.

## Bad
- Options API object does not suit me well. (but It works)
- Would be nice to have typescrits definition.

## Overall 
- It works well and I will use it again.
